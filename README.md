The program was able to show all points according to the example in Lab 4 SQL-database where name, homepage, url, description, watchers and push at.
The program could also display the desired information about Montvale where it shows: zipcode, place, state, latitude and longitude. I have also made a highlight in the title, so it is easier to see/find.
